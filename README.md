## Course Description:
This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.

All the features of this course are available for free.  It does not offer a certificate upon completion.

| [WordNet]              | Build the WordNet digraph: each vertex <i>v</i> is an integer that represents a synset, and each directed edge <i>v→w</i> represents that <i>w</i> is a hypernym of <i>v</i>. The WordNet digraph is a <i>rooted DAG</i>: it is acyclic and has one vertex—the <i>root</i>—that is an ancestor of every other vertex. However, it is not necessarily a tree because a synset can have more than one hypernym. | [view specifications][spec01] |
| [Seam Carving]         | Create a data type that resizes a <i>W</i>-by-<i>H</i> image using the seam-carving technique.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [view specifictaions][spec02] |
| [Baseball Elimination] | Given the standings in a sports division at some point during the season, determine which teams have been mathematically eliminated from winning their division.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [view specifications][spec03] |
| [Boggle]               | Write a program to play the word game Boggle®.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [view specifications][spec04] |
| [Burrows-Wheeler]      | Implement the <i>Burrows–Wheeler data compression algorithm</i>. This revolutionary algorithm outcompresses <i>gzip</i> and <i>PKZIP</i>, is relatively easy to implement, and is not protected by any patents. It forms the basis of the Unix compression utility <i>bzip2</i>.                                                                                                                              | [view specifications][spec05] |
